# CityLabMigrationSurvey

## Introduction
### Background of the challenge
In recent years, digitalization has become considerably more important, especially in the public sector. Although a large number of digital citizen services aim to optimize the efficiency and accessibility of administrative services, it is clear that the use of these services by citizens often falls short of expectations. In a recent interview, Martina Clement, Chief Digital Officer of the state of Berlin, emphasized that the use of the more than 350 available online services still has considerable room for improvement. A large proportion of the population still prefers personal contact at citizens' offices, which points to various challenges and barriers in the use of digital services.

### Problem definition and relevance
The low use of digital citizen services leads to the conclusion that the existing online services may not be sufficiently tailored to the needs and expectations of all user groups. International students in particular, who often face particular linguistic and cultural challenges, could be affected by specific barriers when using these services. Better adaptation and optimization of digital services could not only increase usage by this group, but also facilitate their integration and participation in public life.

### Aim of the survey
This survey aims to gain an in-depth understanding of how international students use existing digital citizen services and what factors determine whether or not they are used. In particular, the survey aims to find answers to the following questions:
- To what extent do international students use the state of Berlin's digital citizen services?
- What are the reasons for using or not using these services?
- What barriers (especially language barriers) exist when using the digital services?
- What opportunities for improvement do international students see to make the online services more accessible (in terms of language)?
  
### Relevance of digital services for international students
Ensuring that digital services are (language) accessible is crucial to ensure that all user groups, including international students, have equal access to the services. Language barriers, complex navigation and insufficient information in different languages can make use considerably more difficult. A targeted survey of user needs and experiences enables the further development of digital citizen services so that they become more inclusive and accessible. This should lead to greater satisfaction and usage.

## Target group analysis
### Definition of international students
The group of international students is heterogeneous and is made up of students from different countries of origin who are studying in another country. The planned survey will focus on a target group of international students who are enrolled at higher education institutions and universities in Berlin. This group includes students with different cultural, linguistic and academic backgrounds. The group of international students can come from both EU and non-EU countries and have different reasons for studying in Berlin. These include, for example, the quality of education, specific study programs or the attractiveness of the city as a place to study.

The following key characteristics of international students are considered in this study:

The international student body is characterized by a large number of nationalities, with students coming from different parts of the world. This leads to linguistic diversity, as students' language skills vary greatly. While some students are fluent in German and/or English, others only have a basic knowledge of these languages. In addition, the academic goals of the students vary considerably. Academic programs range from bachelor's to master's to doctoral programs. Some students also take part in exchange programs or temporary study visits.

## Definition of the survey objectives
### What should the survey find out?
The aim of this survey is to gain an in-depth understanding of how international students in Berlin use the available digital citizen services and which factors influence their use. The survey focuses on the following aspects:

The focus of this study is on the extent of use of digital citizen services by international students in Berlin. The survey aims to determine the extent and purpose of the use of digital citizen services by international students in Berlin. The survey aims to determine which specific digital citizen services are most frequently used by international students in Berlin and which are less frequented.

- Reasons for use or non-use: The aim of this study is to determine which motives or obstacles lead to students using or avoiding digital citizen services. In this regard, technical barriers, language barriers, the user-friendliness of the platforms, trust in the online services and other personal preferences are particularly relevant.

- Hurdles and challenges: A key aspect of the survey is the identification of specific obstacles that international students encounter when using digital services. In particular, technical difficulties, insufficient language support, lack of clarity in navigation and a lack of knowledge about the available services should be mentioned in this regard.

Furthermore, the extent to which linguistic and technical accessibility of digital services is guaranteed must be determined. The survey also aims to explore ways of making digital citizen services accessible, in particular language-accessible. The survey aims to find out which linguistic or cultural adaptations are necessary to optimize and facilitate the use of digital citizen services by international students.

### Specific questions (in progress)
Based on the above objectives, the following specific questions are formulated in order to gather the necessary information:

Questions about the scope of use:
How often do you use digital citizen services of the state of Berlin?
Which of the following digital citizen services have you used in the last six months?

Questions about the reasons for use or non-use:
What are your main reasons for using digital citizen services? 
What are your main reasons for not using digital citizen services? 
To what extent do you trust digital citizen services in terms of data protection and security? 

What difficulties have you experienced when using digital citizen services? 

Questions about (language) accessibility:
What linguistic adaptations would make it easier for you to use digital citizen services?


## Methodology
### Selection of the survey method
The needs survey on digital offerings among international students was conducted by means of an online survey. This decision was based on a number of considerations:

The accessibility of the target group is a key consideration when designing a survey. International students are generally familiar with digital technologies and often have access to digital devices such as laptops, smartphones or tablets. Conducting an online survey makes it possible to reach the previously defined target group effectively and efficiently.

Cost and time savings: Compared to physical questionnaires or face-to-face interviews, an online survey offers a cost-effective and time-efficient way of collecting data. The elimination of printing and postage costs as well as the ability to collect and analyze data in real time are further advantages of this method.

Another advantage of online surveys is their flexibility and convenience. Participants can answer the survey at any time and from any location, making the process as convenient as possible for them. This results in an increased likelihood of higher participation from students, as they can complete the survey at their own pace and at a time that suits them.

### Justification of the choice of method
The survey is conducted using the Google Forms tool, which has established itself as the preferred instrument. The decision to use Google Forms is based on a number of advantages that the tool offers:

The Google Forms user interface is intuitive and easy to use, which makes the tool particularly easy for users to use. The creation and administration of surveys does not require any special technical knowledge, making the tool particularly suitable for teams with different technical skills.

The tool can be used free of charge and only requires a Google account. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on the number of surveys or responses, making the tool particularly suitable for projects with limited budgets.

The tool also offers various customization and design options. Google Forms also offers various customization options, including different question types (e.g. multiple choice, dropdown, short answer or scale questions) and layout options. This allows the questionnaire to be designed to meet the specific requirements of the survey.

The results of the survey are automatically integrated into Google Sheets, another free Google tool, so that real-time data analysis is possible. This allows immediate analysis of the data as well as the derivation of timely conclusions and the creation of reports. The integrated diagram functions allow simple visualization of initial results.

Data protection and security: Google Forms offers a variety of robust data protection options. The ability to design surveys so that responses remain anonymous and the option to enable security features to prevent unauthorized access are also provided. This is particularly relevant to gain the trust of participants and ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### Use of survey tools
As part of the development and implementation of the survey on digital offers for international students, Google Forms is used in the following way:

Creation of the questionnaire:
The questionnaire is created in Google Forms and includes a combination of different question types to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. The question types used include multiple-choice questions to determine the frequency of use, scale questions to measure satisfaction and open questions to collect detailed feedback.

The survey is distributed via various channels that reach the target group of international students. These include university newsletters, social media, student forums and groups as well as direct e-mail distribution lists. The use of an online tool allows the survey to be distributed efficiently and representatively among the target group.

The data is then collected and stored. The answers are stored securely in Google Forms so that they can be accessed at any time. Automatic data storage minimizes the risk of data loss and ensures efficient management and organization of the information collected.

Data collection is followed by analysis and reporting. For this purpose, the data collected in Google Forms is imported into Google Sheets, where it can be subjected to further analysis. The integration allows efficient sorting, filtering and visualization of the data. In addition, further statistical analyses can be carried out to gain deeper insights into the usage patterns and needs of international students.

## Data protection and ethics
### Data protection guidelines and requirements
Compliance with data protection guidelines and requirements is of utmost importance, especially when conducting an online survey that collects personal data. This survey is aimed at international students in Berlin and must therefore comply with the legal framework of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The following principles are essential for this survey and are based on the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**Important principles of the GDPR:**
- The collection and processing of personal data must be carried out in accordance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency. This means that data processing must be fair and transparent towards the data subjects. This implies that students must be adequately informed about the data collection, its purpose and the processing.
- Purpose limitation means that personal data may only be collected and processed for specified, clear and legitimate purposes. Further processing is not permitted if it is incompatible with these purposes.
- The principle of data minimization means that only the data required for the purpose of the survey may be collected. Superfluous or unnecessarily extensive data collection must be avoided.
- The accuracy of the data collected must be ensured. This includes both the factual accuracy and the updating of the data where necessary.
- Storage limitation: Personal data may only be stored for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.
- Integrity and confidentiality: Data must be protected against unauthorized or unlawful access, loss, destruction or damage by appropriate technical and organizational measures.

**Implementation of the data protection guidelines in the survey:**
- The questions in the survey are formulated in such a way that no data is collected that goes beyond the information required to answer the questions and that would enable the identification of the participating persons.
- The survey is conducted using Google Forms, an application that guarantees encryption and secure data transmission.
- The survey results are stored in a secure environment and access to the data is restricted to authorized persons only.
- Participants are provided with a transparent privacy policy that explains the type and purpose of data collection.
  
### Obtaining consent
Obtaining the consent of participants is a fundamental component of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This ensures that participants provide their data voluntarily and consciously.

**The declaration of consent comprises the following elements:**
- Informed consent Before students participate in the survey, they must be fully informed about the survey, the data collected, the purpose of data collection, the way in which data is processed and the duration of data storage.
- Participation in the survey must be completely voluntary. Participation in the survey must not be forced and the decision not to participate must not have any negative consequences for the participants.
- Information must be provided that consent can be withdrawn at any time and without giving reasons. The possibility of withdrawal and the associated procedures must be clearly communicated.
- Consent must be comprehensible for the participants. This can be done, for example, by means of a clear affirmative action, such as ticking a box in Google Forms, by which participants confirm that they have read and understood the privacy policy and consent to the processing of their data.

**The practical implementation is as follows:**
Before the survey begins in Google Forms, a consent section is added informing participants how their data will be used. 
They must give their explicit consent before proceeding to the survey itself. Consent is documented and stored securely to ensure proof of consent.

### Anonymity and confidentiality
The anonymity of the survey is guaranteed as no personal identifiers are collected. The survey is designed in such a way that no directly identifiable information such as names, e-mail addresses or telephone numbers are collected. 
Where possible, personal data will not be collected.
Participation is anonymous. Participants will be provided with a link to the survey that does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about their identity. No mechanisms are used that allow participants to be tracked or identified.

**Ensuring confidentiality:**
- Data access: Access to the collected data is strictly limited to authorized persons who are directly involved in the analysis and evaluation of the survey. The data will only be passed on to third parties if this is required by law or if the participants have given their express consent.
- Storage and deletion: The storage and deletion of the data takes place in a secure environment and is only maintained for as long as is necessary for the analysis of the survey and the preparation of the final report. After completion of the project, the data will be deleted in accordance with the applicable data protection guidelines.

These measures are implemented as follows:
- The “Anonymized responses” setting is activated in Google Forms to ensure that no personal data is automatically collected.
- All data is stored in a secure and encrypted format to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data.
- Access to the survey data is restricted to the project team only. All team members are required to sign a confidentiality agreement.
