# CityLabMigrationSurvey

## Introduction
### Background of the challenge
In recent years, digitalization has become considerably more important, especially in the public sector. Although a large number of digital citizen services aim to optimize the efficiency and accessibility of administrative services, it is clear that the use of these services by citizens often falls short of expectations. In a recent interview, Martina Clement, Chief Digital Officer of the state of Berlin, emphasized that the use of the more than 350 available online services still has considerable room for improvement. A large proportion of the population still prefers personal contact at citizens' offices, which points to various challenges and barriers in the use of digital services.

### Problem definition and relevance
The low use of digital citizen services leads to the conclusion that the existing online services may not be sufficiently tailored to the needs and expectations of all user groups. International students in particular, who often face particular linguistic and cultural challenges, could be affected by specific barriers when using these services. Better adaptation and optimization of digital services could not only increase usage by this group, but also facilitate their integration and participation in public life.

### Aim of the survey
This survey aims to gain an in-depth understanding of how international students use existing digital citizen services and what factors determine whether or not they are used. In particular, the survey aims to find answers to the following questions:
- To what extent do international students use the state of Berlin's digital citizen services?
- What are the reasons for using or not using these services?
- What barriers (especially language barriers) exist when using the digital services?
- What opportunities for improvement do international students see to make the online services more accessible (in terms of language)?
  
### Relevance of digital services for international students
Ensuring that digital services are (language) accessible is crucial to ensure that all user groups, including international students, have equal access to the services. Language barriers, complex navigation and insufficient information in different languages can make use considerably more difficult. A targeted survey of user needs and experiences enables the further development of digital citizen services so that they become more inclusive and accessible. This should lead to greater satisfaction and usage.

## Target group analysis
### Definition of international students
The group of international students is heterogeneous and is made up of students from different countries of origin who are studying in another country. The planned survey will focus on a target group of international students who are enrolled at higher education institutions and universities in Berlin. This group includes students with different cultural, linguistic and academic backgrounds. The group of international students can come from both EU and non-EU countries and have different reasons for studying in Berlin. These include, for example, the quality of education, specific study programs or the attractiveness of the city as a place to study.

The following key characteristics of international students are considered in this study:

The international student body is characterized by a large number of nationalities, with students coming from different parts of the world. This leads to linguistic diversity, as students' language skills vary greatly. While some students are fluent in German and/or English, others only have a basic knowledge of these languages. In addition, the academic goals of the students vary considerably. Academic programs range from bachelor's to master's to doctoral programs. Some students also take part in exchange programs or temporary study visits.

## Pre-Survey Interviews at a Citizens' Registration Office in Berlin
As part of the preparatory work for an upcoming survey, we conducted a series of interviews outside a citizens' registration office in Berlin. The objective of these interviews was to gather qualitative insights that could inform the structure and content of the main survey. This approach allowed us to understand the public's perceptions, experiences, and priorities, which are crucial for crafting relevant survey questions.

### Methodology
The interviews were conducted over a period of two days, targeting a diverse group of individuals as they visited the office. We approached people, requesting a few minutes of their time to discuss their experiences with the digital citizen services. Each interview lasted approximately 5-10 minutes, focusing on open-ended questions that encouraged participants to share their thoughts freely.

### Interview Questions
The questions were designed to be open-ended to elicit detailed responses. Key questions included:
-	“Have you ever used online citizen services of the city of Berlin?”
-	If no: “Why don’t you use the city’s digital citizen services?”
-	If yes: "What experiences have you had with the online citizen services?"

### Insights Gained
The insights from these interviews were invaluable, revealing common patterns and unique perspectives on visitor efficiency, challenges, and satisfaction. These insights helped identify key focus areas for the survey, such as efficiency, strengths and weaknesses of digital services as well as overall user satisfaction.
Application to the Survey
Based on the interviews, we tailored the survey questions to be directly relevant to the issues and suggestions raised by the respondents. This not only ensures that the survey is based on real user experiences, but also increases the likelihood of meaningful respondent engagement.
In summary, the pre-survey interviews were instrumental in shaping a well-informed and focused survey. By understanding the public's first-hand experiences and expectations, we can better address the issues at hand and effectively contribute to service improvements of digital services.


## Definition of the survey objectives
### What should the survey find out?
As already mentioned, the aim of this survey is to gain an in-depth understanding of how international students in Berlin use the available digital citizen services and which factors influence their use. The survey focuses on the following aspects:

The focus of this study is on the extent of use of digital citizen services by international students in Berlin. The survey aims to determine the extent and purpose of the use of digital citizen services by international students in Berlin. The survey aims to determine which specific digital citizen services are most frequently used by international students in Berlin and which are less frequented.

- Reasons for use or non-use: The aim of this study is to determine which motives or obstacles lead to students using or avoiding digital citizen services. In this regard, technical barriers, language barriers, the user-friendliness of the platforms, trust in the online services and other personal preferences are particularly relevant.

- Hurdles and challenges: A key aspect of the survey is the identification of specific obstacles that international students encounter when using digital services. In particular, technical difficulties, insufficient language support, lack of clarity in navigation and a lack of knowledge about the available services should be mentioned in this regard.

Furthermore, the extent to which linguistic and technical accessibility of digital services is guaranteed must be determined. The survey also aims to explore ways of making digital citizen services accessible, in particular language-accessible. The survey aims to find out which linguistic or cultural adaptations are necessary to optimize and facilitate the use of digital citizen services by international students.

### Specific questions 
Based on the above objectives, the following specific questions are formulated in order to gather the necessary information:

Questions about the scope of use:
- How often do you use digital citizen services of the state of Berlin?
- Which of the following digital citizen services have you used in the last six months?

Questions about the reasons for use or non-use:
- What are your main reasons for using digital citizen services? 
- What are your main reasons for not using digital citizen services? 
- To what extent do you trust digital citizen services in terms of data protection and security? 
- What difficulties have you experienced when using digital citizen services? 

Questions about (language) accessibility:
- What linguistic adaptations would make it easier for you to use digital citizen services?


## Methodology
### Selection of the survey method
The needs survey on digital offerings among international students was conducted by means of an online survey. This decision was based on a number of considerations:

The accessibility of the target group is a key consideration when designing a survey. International students are generally familiar with digital technologies and often have access to digital devices such as laptops, smartphones or tablets. Conducting an online survey makes it possible to reach the previously defined target group effectively and efficiently.

Cost and time savings: Compared to physical questionnaires or face-to-face interviews, an online survey offers a cost-effective and time-efficient way of collecting data. The elimination of printing and postage costs as well as the ability to collect and analyze data in real time are further advantages of this method.

Another advantage of online surveys is their flexibility and convenience. Participants can answer the survey at any time and from any location, making the process as convenient as possible for them. This results in an increased likelihood of higher participation from students, as they can complete the survey at their own pace and at a time that suits them.

### Justification of the choice of method
The survey is conducted using the Google Forms tool, which has established itself as the preferred instrument. The decision to use Google Forms is based on a number of advantages that the tool offers:

The Google Forms user interface is intuitive and easy to use, which makes the tool particularly easy for users to use. The creation and administration of surveys does not require any special technical knowledge, making the tool particularly suitable for teams with different technical skills.

The tool can be used free of charge and only requires a Google account. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on the number of surveys or responses, making the tool particularly suitable for projects with limited budgets.

The tool also offers various customization and design options. Google Forms also offers various customization options, including different question types (e.g. multiple choice, dropdown, short answer or scale questions) and layout options. This allows the questionnaire to be designed to meet the specific requirements of the survey.

The results of the survey are automatically integrated into Google Sheets, another free Google tool, so that real-time data analysis is possible. This allows immediate analysis of the data as well as the derivation of timely conclusions and the creation of reports. The integrated diagram functions allow simple visualization of initial results.

Data protection and security: Google Forms offers a variety of robust data protection options. The ability to design surveys so that responses remain anonymous and the option to enable security features to prevent unauthorized access are also provided. This is particularly relevant to gain the trust of participants and ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### Use of survey tools
As part of the development and implementation of the survey on digital offers for international students, Google Forms is used in the following way:

Creation of the questionnaire:
The questionnaire is created in Google Forms and includes a combination of different question types to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. The question types used include multiple-choice questions to determine the frequency of use, scale questions to measure satisfaction and open questions to collect detailed feedback.

The survey is distributed via various channels that reach the target group of international students. These include university newsletters, social media, student forums and groups as well as direct e-mail distribution lists. The use of an online tool allows the survey to be distributed efficiently and representatively among the target group.

The data is then collected and stored. The answers are stored securely in Google Forms so that they can be accessed at any time. Automatic data storage minimizes the risk of data loss and ensures efficient management and organization of the information collected.

Data collection is followed by analysis and reporting. For this purpose, the data collected in Google Forms is imported into Google Sheets, where it can be subjected to further analysis. The integration allows efficient sorting, filtering and visualization of the data. In addition, further statistical analyses can be carried out to gain deeper insights into the usage patterns and needs of international students.

## Development of the questionnaire
### Structure and layout of the questionnaire
The questionnaire is divided into four sections, each addressing a key area related to the use of digital citizen services by international students in Berlin:
- Use of digital services: This section aims to establish how frequently international students use the digital services provided by the Berlin administration, including specific services such as online registration, appointments and other e-government services.
- Language barriers and translation tools: This section explores whether language barriers play a role in hindering the use of these services. It also assesses the effectiveness of tools like Google Translate that students may rely on for understanding the services.
- Suggestions for improvement: This section provides respondents with the opportunity to suggest ways to improve the usability and accessibility of digital services, with a focus on language support and user experience.
- Open feedback: Here, students are encouraged to give any additional insights on what might motivate them to use the online services more frequently instead of visiting administrative offices in person.

The survey is available in three languages – German, English and Ukrainian – to cater to the linguistic diversity of international students. The overall structure is designed to move from factual questions to more open-ended ones.

### Types of questions (open questions, closed questions, scale questions, etc.)
A mix of question types is used in the survey to collect a broad range of data:
- Closed questions: These are used to obtain clear, quantifiable responses. For example, students are asked how often they use Berlin’s digital services, with predefined options for frequency.
- Scale questions: To assess the level of satisfaction with the usability of translation tools, scale-based questions are included. These questions help in gauging the effectiveness of tools like Google Translate.
- Open-ended questions: To gather more detailed insights, open-ended questions invite students to express their thoughts freely. This allows for deeper understanding of personal experiences and unique challenges.
- Multiple-choice questions with the option for multiple responses: In certain areas, such as the barriers to service usage, students can select multiple reasons.

### Formulation of the questions: comprehensibility, neutrality, relevance
The questions are formulated to be easily understood and neutrally worded, ensuring that participants can respond without being led toward a particular answer:
- Comprehensibility: The language of the questions is kept simple and direct, ensuring that students from various linguistic backgrounds can easily understand the content. For instance, "What prevents you from using digital services more often?" avoids complex phrasing.
- Neutrality: Questions are worded in a way that does not suggest any particular response. For example, "Do you use translation tools like Google Translate when interacting with digital services?" allows for an unbiased reflection of students' behavior.
- Relevance: Each question is closely tied to the core objectives of the study, ensuring that the data gathered will directly contribute to understanding how to enhance the use of digital services by international students.

### Pre-testing and revision of the questionnaire
Given the limited timeframe for the project, it is not feasible to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the questionnaire on a large scale. Instead, the questionnaire is being revised by the team members involved in the project.

## Data protection and ethics
### Data protection guidelines and requirements
Compliance with data protection guidelines and requirements is of utmost importance, especially when conducting an online survey that collects personal data. This survey is aimed at international students in Berlin and must therefore comply with the legal framework of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The following principles are essential for this survey and are based on the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**Important principles of the GDPR:**
- The collection and processing of personal data must be carried out in accordance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency. This means that data processing must be fair and transparent towards the data subjects. This implies that students must be adequately informed about the data collection, its purpose and the processing.
- Purpose limitation means that personal data may only be collected and processed for specified, clear and legitimate purposes. Further processing is not permitted if it is incompatible with these purposes.
- The principle of data minimization means that only the data required for the purpose of the survey may be collected. Superfluous or unnecessarily extensive data collection must be avoided.
- The accuracy of the data collected must be ensured. This includes both the factual accuracy and the updating of the data where necessary.
- Storage limitation: Personal data may only be stored for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.
- Integrity and confidentiality: Data must be protected against unauthorized or unlawful access, loss, destruction or damage by appropriate technical and organizational measures.

**Implementation of the data protection guidelines in the survey:**
- The questions in the survey are formulated in such a way that no data is collected that goes beyond the information required to answer the questions and that would enable the identification of the participating persons.
- The survey is conducted using Google Forms, an application that guarantees encryption and secure data transmission.
- The survey results are stored in a secure environment and access to the data is restricted to authorized persons only.
- Participants are provided with a transparent privacy policy that explains the type and purpose of data collection.
  
### Obtaining consent
Obtaining the consent of participants is a fundamental component of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This ensures that participants provide their data voluntarily and consciously.

**The declaration of consent comprises the following elements:**
- Informed consent Before students participate in the survey, they must be fully informed about the survey, the data collected, the purpose of data collection, the way in which data is processed and the duration of data storage.
- Participation in the survey must be completely voluntary. Participation in the survey must not be forced and the decision not to participate must not have any negative consequences for the participants.
- Information must be provided that consent can be withdrawn at any time and without giving reasons. The possibility of withdrawal and the associated procedures must be clearly communicated.
- Consent must be comprehensible for the participants. This can be done, for example, by means of a clear affirmative action, such as ticking a box in Google Forms, by which participants confirm that they have read and understood the privacy policy and consent to the processing of their data.

**The practical implementation is as follows:**
Before the survey begins in Google Forms, a consent section is added informing participants how their data will be used. 
They must give their explicit consent before proceeding to the survey itself. Consent is documented and stored securely to ensure proof of consent.

### Anonymity and confidentiality
The anonymity of the survey is guaranteed as no personal identifiers are collected. The survey is designed in such a way that no directly identifiable information such as names, e-mail addresses or telephone numbers are collected. 
Where possible, personal data will not be collected.
Participation is anonymous. Participants will be provided with a link to the survey that does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about their identity. No mechanisms are used that allow participants to be tracked or identified.

**Ensuring confidentiality:**
- Data access: Access to the collected data is strictly limited to authorized persons who are directly involved in the analysis and evaluation of the survey. The data will only be passed on to third parties if this is required by law or if the participants have given their express consent.
- Storage and deletion: The storage and deletion of the data takes place in a secure environment and is only maintained for as long as is necessary for the analysis of the survey and the preparation of the final report. After completion of the project, the data will be deleted in accordance with the applicable data protection guidelines.

These measures are implemented as follows:
- The “Anonymized responses” setting is activated in Google Forms to ensure that no personal data is automatically collected.
- All data is stored in a secure and encrypted format to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data.
- Access to the survey data is restricted to the project team only. All team members are required to sign a confidentiality agreement.

## Implementation of the survey
### Schedule and deadlines
The project will be completed within nine days, with the presentation of the final results scheduled for the tenth day. 
Therefore, it is imperative that the survey be completed as expeditiously as possible. Given the limited time frame, it may be necessary to consider the creation of a brief survey that does not unduly burden the participant and can be processed with minimal delay.

### Selection of participants
Participants are not selected based on specific criteria outside of the task. Restrictions are made based on questions that allow participants to be categorized into, for example, EU and non-EU countries.
In addition, CityLab Berlin makes its reach available in order to send the survey to as many people as possible. This enables representative data to be generated for research.
In addition, the reach of Berlin's universities, in particular the HTW and HWR, can be used.
However, according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it is not possible for us to make a pre-selection based on personal criteria.

## Data Analysis

### Preparation of the Survey Results
The survey was prepared in three languages: English, Arabic and Ukrainian. Unfortunately, we received no responses in Ukrainian, so the analysis will focus on the English and Arabic results. The survey aimed to understand the difficulties people face when using digital citizen services in Berlin and to find out what improvements could make these services more accessible and user-friendly.

The questions focused on participants’ usage of digital services, the barriers they encounter and what features would encourage them to use the services more frequently. Both multiple-choice and open-ended questions were used to gather qualitative and quantitative data.

### Evaluation Methods
The analysis of the data involved reviewing the responses for both the English and Arabic versions of the survey. We primarily looked at multiple-choice questions to identify common barriers to using digital services, such as difficulty understanding the websites, confusing navigation, lack of language options, and trust issues with online services.

We also analyzed the open-ended question responses to understand the most significant incentives for using digital services. Participants provided insightful feedback on the need for simple user interfaces and the availability of enough slots for appointments, as well as the general preference for faster online services over in-person visits.

For both language groups, we looked at the following:
1. Frequency of use of digital services.
2. Barriers to usage.
3. Importance of improvements like better language support, simpler navigation, more information and the introduction of a chatbot.

### Tools for Data Analysis
We used Google Forms' built-in analytics tools to create charts and graphs based on the responses. This helped visualize the key trends and preferences from the survey results. Additionally we exported the data to Google Sheets for more detailed comparisons between the English and Arabic responses.

The standard charts generated by Google Forms helped us quickly understand which areas respondents identified as problematic and where improvements could make digital services more accessible. The tools also made it easier to compare responses from different language groups, especially since no responses were submitted in Ukrainian.

The results suggest that participants highly value simpler website structures and more information about available digital services. There were also moderate suggestions for chatbot implementation, but language support was crucial for the Arabic respondents, indicating a need for multilingual options on digital platforms.

## Conclusion
### Summary of the most important findings
In this project, we found both good and bad points about the online services. First, chatbot support is not very important for most users, as many do not seem to use it. However, there is a clear demand for online services, showing that people are willing to use them. The browser translator helps in some cases but does not always work well.

On the negative side, we noticed several problems with the online services. The system is complex and the website is hard to navigate, making it difficult for users to find the information they need. There is also not enough detailed information about the available services, which causes more confusion. Finally, the lack of language support makes it hard for non-native speakers to access the services.

In summary, the online services need to be simpler and more user-friendly, with better language support and clearer information to help users.

### Outlook for future developments and research:

In the future, it is important to focus on simplifying the online services' structure and process. Easier-to-use services will motivate more people to use them. One key area for improvement is to add better language support, especially for non-native speakers, to make the platforms available to more people.

Further research could look at the specific needs of different user groups, especially those who have difficulties with the current system. It could also be useful to study how people interact with online services and to test new features, such as a better browser translator or easier navigation.

In general, the goal should be to create more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly digital services that meet the needs of a diverse population.
